# **Exploratory Analysis of Billionaires**

A simple Python project for **Data Analysis** using **Pandas, SQLite, and Streamlit**.

Storytelling through numbers is a powerful skill. In this project, I built a **Billionaire Statistics Dashboard** using **Python, SQL, and Streamlit** to uncover key trends behind the richest individuals.

This README walks through the project, breaking down **data preparation, database creation, and visualization techniques** that brought these insights to life!

## **📌 Dataset & Preparation**  

The dataset is from **Kaggle's Billionaires Statistics Dataset**, containing information on individuals' **net worth, industries, country of residence, and more**.  

Since real-world datasets are often messy, I started with **data cleaning and preprocessing** using **Pandas**:  

- Removed unnecessary columns to streamline analysis.  
- Filled missing values for attributes like **age, city, birthDate, and organization**.  
- Ensured consistency in numeric fields such as **birthYear and birthDay**.  

Once cleaned, the data was stored in **SQLite** for efficient querying and analysis.

## **💾 What is SQLite?**  

SQLite is a **lightweight, self-contained database engine** that doesn't require a separate server process. Unlike traditional databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, **SQLite operates directly on disk files**, making it ideal for small to medium-scale applications.  

### **Key Features of SQLite:**  
✔ **Serverless** - No need for database installation or configuration.  
✔ **File-based** - Stores all data in a single `.db` file.  
✔ **ACID-Compliant** – Ensures data integrity and transactions.  
✔ **Built-in Python Support** – No extra libraries required.

## **🔍 Extracting Insights**  

With the cleaned data stored in SQLite, I chose **four key research questions** and wrote **SQL queries** to uncover insights.  

### **📊 1. Which Industries Produce the Most Billionaires?**  

From the analysis:  
- **Finance & Investments** leads the way, producing the highest number of billionaires.  
- **Technology and Manufacturing** follow closely.  
- **Fashion & Retail, Food & Beverage, and Real Estate** also stand out.  
- **Sports, Telecom, and Gambling & Casinos** contribute the least.  

### **👨‍💼👩‍💼 2. Is There a Gender Disparity Among Billionaires?**  

Using **SQL queries**, I grouped billionaires by **gender** and visualized trends. The results revealed a **stark gender divide**:  

- **Male billionaires significantly outnumber female billionaires across all industries**.  
- **Fashion & Retail, Healthcare, and Food & Beverage** have relatively higher female representation.  
- **Finance, Technology, and Manufacturing** remain **male-dominated**.  

### **🌍 3. Top Countries with the Most Billionaires**  

- **United States** dominates billionaire counts, followed by **China**.  
- **India, Germany, and the UK** rank high, reflecting strong **business and investment environments**.  
- **Switzerland, Hong Kong, Italy, and Singapore** are notable financial hubs.  

### **💰 4. Average Net Worth by Industry**  

Beyond billionaire counts, I explored **which industries generate the wealthiest individuals**.  

- **Automotive, Fashion & Retail, and Technology** lead in net worth.  
- **Gambling & Casinos, Media & Entertainment, and Finance & Investments** show high **average net worths**.

## **📊 Building the Dashboard with Streamlit**  

To present these insights **interactively**, I built a **Streamlit dashboard** with:  

- **Custom Styling with CSS** for enhanced visuals.  
- **Dynamic Charts** using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.  
- **SQL-Driven Analysis** for **real-time data querying**.
